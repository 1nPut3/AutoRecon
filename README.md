This is still in development and will most likely have many bugs and spelling errors.

If You find a bug please put comment in the issues page @ the GitHub repository.

Anybody can copy and improve the code as long as you give credit where credit is due.

Many more improvements are on the way like complete ghost scan, easy to read printed results
in one file from all scanners, a banner, more documentation, and more.
